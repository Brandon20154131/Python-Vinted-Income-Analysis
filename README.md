## 📖 Project Overview

This project analyses 76 resale transactions recorded between June 2023 and October 2025, focusing on revenue growth, sales consistency and pricing behaviour.
The analysis was carried out in Python using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.

The goal was to understand how the business evolved over time and how changes to pricing strategy and inventory affected sales performance.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Total revenue increased from £714.50 (2023) to £5,150.00 (2025).

- The average transaction value rose to £104.52, with a median of £56.50, showing a right-skewed distribution.

- Sales frequency improved from 14.22 days between transactions to 11.31 days showing stronger consistency.

- The introduction of mid-range pricing (£50–£120) reduced dependence on premium sales and increased overall stability.

- Premium items continued to contribute ~30% of total revenue, maintaining profit diversity.

## 🧠 Business Impact

Following the analysis, key recommendations were adopted:

Expand mid-range inventory to stabilise revenue.

Maintain selective high-value listings to preserve margin opportunities.

Introduce consistent pricing tiers to improve predictability.

Track categorical and buyer-level data for future segmentation and retention analysis.

The follow-up dataset shows stronger sales momentum, improved consistency and a clearer data-driven understanding of performance.
